This scripts, as the previous decriptions indicates, were created by [**dano**](https://community.mp3tag.de/u/dano/summary), an user from the [MP3Tag Community](https://community.mp3tag.de) (forums, brefore the change to a Discord platform), and they take information from the Encyclopaedia Metallum (a.k.a. Metal Archives, or MA).

Since he doesn't seems to be very active lately, nor there signs that he's doing updates to the scripts, I'm making this repository in order to keep them updated, as the layout on MA changes (if it happens).
